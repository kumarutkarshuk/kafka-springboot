- Kafka is a tool used to send, receive, and process large amounts of real-time data between systems in a reliable and scalable way.

- Kafka is like a messaging system where:
  - One system produces data (called a producer),
  - Another system consumes that data (called a consumer),
  - Kafka sits in the middle as a broker to pass data around safely.
It works like a log â€” data is written in order and read in order.

- It tackles low throughput of DBs, but Kafka has less storage compared to DBs
